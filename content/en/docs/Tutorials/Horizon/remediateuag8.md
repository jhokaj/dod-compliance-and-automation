## Overview
Automated remediation of VMware Unified Access Gateway (UAG) does not currently exist. UAG specific controls must be manually remediated. However, the underlying Photon OS controls can be automated by utilizing the provided Ansible content within the [Photon repository](https://github.com/vmware/dod-compliance-and-automation/tree/master/photon/3.0/ansible/vmware-photon-3.0-stig-ansible-hardening).
