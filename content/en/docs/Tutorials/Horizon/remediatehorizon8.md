## Overview
Automated remediation of VMware Horizon 8 does not currently exist. Group Policy Object (GPO) templates for Windows Connection Server, Agent, and Client can be downloaded from VMware and imported into an Active Directory environment. The settings can then be configured within a GPO and linked the the appropriate Organizational Units within the Active Directory.
