  title 'tc Server Secured connectors must be configured to use strong encryption ciphers.'
  desc  "
    The tc Server has several remote communications channels. Examples are user requests via http/https, communication to a backend database, or communication to authenticate users. The encryption used to communicate must match the data that is being retrieved or presented.

    The Tomcat <Connector> element controls the TLS protocol and the associated ciphers used. If a strong cipher is not selected, an attacker may be able to circumvent encryption protections that are configured for the connector. Strong ciphers must be employed when configuring a secured connector.

    The configuration attribute and its values depend on what HTTPS implementation is being utilized. It may be either a Java-based implementation (e.g., JSSE â€” with BIO and/or NIO connectors), or an OpenSSL-based implementation (with an APR connector).

    TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 ciphers are configured via the server.xml file on a per connector basis. For a list of approved ciphers, refer to NIST SP 800-52 section 3.3.1.1.

    For Connectors, at the command prompt, run the following command:

    # xmllint -xpath \"//Connector/\" $CATALINA_BASE/conf/server.xml.

    Examine each <Connector> element that is not a redirect to a secure port. Identify the ciphers that are configured on each connector and determine if any of the ciphers are not secure.

    If ciphers are not defined, or insecure ciphers are configured for use, this is a finding.

    EXAMPLE:
        <Connector port=\"8443\" protocol=\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol\"
                   maxThreads=\"150\" SSLEnabled=\"true\" scheme=\"https\" secure=\"true\" >
            <UpgradeProtocol className=\"org.apache.coyote.http2.Http2Protocol\" />
            <SSLHostConfig honorCipherOrder=\"true\" disableCompression=\"true\" protocols=\"TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3\"

                  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,

    Navigate to and open $CATALINA_HOME/server.xml.

    Navigate to each of the <Connector> nodes that is not a redirect to a secure port.

    Configure each <SSLHostConfig> node with the setting 'protocols=\"TLSv1.2\"'.

    EXAMPLE:
        <Connector port=\"8443\" protocol=\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol\"
